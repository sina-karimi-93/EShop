# EShop
The project is about to developing an online shop.

I have tried to use MongoDB and Falcon (Python API Framework) for backend.
In addition, I am using Flutter for mobile and desktop version.
Furthermore, for web version, I am using NextJS.

This is a practice project, and I am trying to use everything that I learn and
want to learn in it. For instance, Design UI, Authentication, Artificial Intelligence and so on.
